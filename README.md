# Spaceship Battle and Hunting!  
A fun multiplayer browser-based online spaceship-themed game using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) as frontend, [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) as backend, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as cloud database and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org) for realtime communication. We also used [redux-firestore](https://github.com/prescottprue/redux-firestore) for accessing data easily.
